# Allstate-Claims-Severity
When a devastating insured event happens, clients would appreciate a worry-free claims experience where they donâ€™t have to push paper with their insurance agent. Allstate is looking for an automated method of predicting the cost, and hence severity, of claims.
Since the data has a target output variable, this is a supervised problem where the algorithm will be trained to find patterns of data that will produce the closest solution to the target output. Furthermore, since the target output variable is continuous, a regression type analysis would be preferable rather than classification. This is because we are calculating a particular value for each object and not placing the object in a class.
